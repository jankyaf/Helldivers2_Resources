# Armor & Booster Effects on Speed & Stamina (as of 4/16/2024)
The following summarizes the effects of armor & booster combinations on travel speed and stamina, and assumes a flat surface with no obstructions.  Credit for the data mined goes to [Ferit The Bandit](https://www.youtube.com/@FeritTheBandit), the full video can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UpAYL79ifQ. I just consolidated and presented the data in a much more digestible way.

##  Raw Values
### Walk Speed
    Light  = 3.47 m/s (3.47 m/s w/ booster) <-no increase
    Medium = 2.98 m/s (3.13 m/s w/ booster)
    Heavy  = 2.69 m/s (2.94 m/s w/ booster)
### Sprint Speed
    Light  = 5.88 m/s (5.88 m/s w/ booster) <-no increase
    Medium = 5.13 m/s (5.56 m/s w/ booster)
    Heavy  = 4.55 m/s (4.76 m/s w/ booster)
### Sprint Duration
    Light  = 29.8 sec (38.5 sec w/ booster)
    Medium = 23.5 sec (30.0 sec w/ booster)
    Heavy  = 16.5 sec (21.0 sec w/ booster)
### Stamina Recovery Time
    Light  = 9.0 sec (7.0 sec w/ booster)
    Medium = 7.1 sec (5.5 sec w/ booster)
    Heavy  = 5.0 sec (4.0 sec w/ booster)

## Comparative Values (this is prob what you wanna see)
When wearing Light Armor, walking & sprint speed is not affected by the booster.  For Medium Armor the effect on walk/sprint speed are more substantial and the Heavy Armor has the largest impact from the booster out of the three.
### Light Armor Relative Walk Speed
    29% faster than Heavy Armor
    18% faster than Heavy Armor + booster
    16% faster than Medium Armor
    11% faster than Medium Armor + booster
### Medium Armor (w/ booster) Relative Walk Speed
     16% faster than Heavy Armor
    6.5% faster than Heavy Armor + booster
      5% faster than Medium Armor
### Light Armor Relative Sprint Speed
    29% faster than Heavy Armor
    24% faster than Heavy Armor + booster
    15% faster than Medium Armor
     6% faster than Medium Armor + booster
